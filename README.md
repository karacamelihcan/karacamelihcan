## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University Software Engineering and Computer Engineering departments. I am actively working as a Software Engineer. Although I mostly develop with .NET on the Backend, I am also trying to improve myself in the Frontend area. To briefly talk about my working life, I am currently working as an IT Manager within the Winkel Group. In the previous years, I worked as a Junior Software Developer at Bermuda Technology and as a Backend Developer Intern at Yesil Science. You can find detailed information about the projects I have developed in the relevant section
